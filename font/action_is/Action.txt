June 17, 1999: Shagadelic News Flash!!!

"Action Is: The Sequel" is the obvious follow-up
to the surprisingly popular "Action Is" freeware
font from Brain Eaters Font Co.

A short history on both fonts:
The pencil sketch for the "Action Is" typeface 
was sent to Brad at Brain Eaters by Jeff Levine,
(who works for Steve Alaimo the former singer who 
co-hosted "Where The Action Is" in the 1960s).

A souvenir photo album from the show had the 
title displayed in these letters, and Jeff made a
pencil tracing, making adaptions for the missing 
characters and punctuation. Brad took and refined 
the sketches and created the font.

Nicknamed the "Austin Powers"-style font by 
collectors, "Action Is" reflects the flower power 
of the 60's and early 70s. Being the "Austin Powers" 
sequel is now in the theaters, it seemed only right 
for a sequel to the original "Action Is" font. 
Jeff did the remix for this version.
